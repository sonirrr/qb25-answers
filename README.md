#1.3 
#Two tissue types (Fe and LFC.Fe) are clustering with each other 
#one replicate of Fe is in the LFC.Fe cluster and vice versa
#Two values have been mislabeled (rows 12 and 13)

#the first principle component is explained by 
#Physical location in the gut is separating out the clusters 
#(RNA expression from different tissue types correlates to different regions in the gut)

#3 
#four clusters did not show significant enrichment
#why???
