#2.2
#p-value for maternal age vs dnm frequency: 2e-16 ***
#slope for linear regression 0.60255 - for every year that the mother is older, the frequency of dnm mutations increases by 60%
#This does roughly match my plot - from the plot we can see a rought correlation where every 10 yr increase in maternal age increases DNM frequency by a little over 5 years (slope a little greater than 0.5)
#the p-value is very small, making this relationship significant
#the probability that this level of association between maternal age and DNM frequency arose by chance is very, very small (essentially zero), indicating a very strong correlation

#2.3
#paternal age vs dnm frequency
#slope for linear regression: 0.45708
#p-value: <2e016 ***
#for every year that the father is older, the frequency of dnm mutations increases by about 45%
#this does roughly match my plot - every 10 year increase in paternal age increases DNM frequency by a little under 5 years (slop a little under 0.5)
#this p-value is very small, making this relationship significant
#the probablility that this level of association between paternal age and DNM frequency arose by change is very, very small (essentially zero), indicating a very strong correlation

#2.4
#paternal age = dnm frequency * 0.457 + 7.017
#for a 50.5 year old father
#50.5 = (dnm frequency * 0.457) + 7.017
#dnm frequency = 103.5
