#1.3 
#Two tissue types (Fe and LFC.Fe) are clustering with each other 
#one replicate of Fe is in the LFC.Fe cluster and vice versa
#Two values have been mislabeled (rows 12 and 13)

#the first principle component is explained by 
#Physical location in the gut is separating out the clusters 
#(RNA expression from different tissue types correlates to different regions in the gut)

#3 
#cluster 3 and cluster 7 showed significant enrichment
#the top enriched categories for both clusters were involved in 
#the immune response and reponse to symbionts
#this makes sense because the fruit fly gut is populated with many different bacteria/microbiota
#and so it makes sense that the genes expression in the gut is involved in controlling
#these microbiota and making sure it doesn't overrun/allow pathogenic bacteria to grow
